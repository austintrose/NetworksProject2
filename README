Server usage:
  python asciivids.py

Client usage:
  python asciivids.py --client

To specify drop rate, add --drop=N flag, where 0<=N<100
To specify corrupt rate, add --corrupt=N flag, where 0<=N<100
To switch from GBN (default) to SR, add --sr flag. Client and server must agree.

Stats:
    In each run, we set the server and client to the same drop/corrupt
    combination.

    In each run, the results we collect are the sum of client and server
    reported values. Except for "time to recognize" which is only reported
    on the client.

    Each run consisted of the client issuing the "LIST" command, and receiving
    the full response.

    The tables show averages over 10 runs.

    SR:
    0       0
    5       5
    20      5
    20      20
    40      40
    70      70
