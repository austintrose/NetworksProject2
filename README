Datalink Layer Header:
1 byte  unsigned | checksum
4 bytes unsigned | datasize

TODO:
    General:
        - Need to collect and report statistics:

    Application Layer:
        - Should have max packet payload size 256 bytes.
        - Must define a few commands, and one command must involve a file transfer.

    Data Link Layer:
        - Implement reliable transport with ACKs, NACKs, sequence numbers, etc.
        - Need to define size of one data link frame, and size of window (probably like 10 frames).
        - Need mechanism for one application layer packet becoming multiple frames.
        - Timers for retransmitting unacked: http://stackoverflow.com/a/18406263

    Physical Layer:
        - Drop rate integer 0 to 100, probability of dropping each full data link frame.
        - Corrupt rate integer 0 to 100, probability of randomly altering one byte in a data link frame.
